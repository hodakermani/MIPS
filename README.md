MIPS
==
This project includes a full implementation of MIPS architecture containing SRAM and cache. In addition, it supports forwarding and hazard control in case of data hazard or control hazard detection.
There is also a report, which contains a full explanation of the steps taken for implementing each module of this project.

## How to Run
If you intend to use the SRAM memory, you should import this project in Quartus. Then select mips.v as your top-level module. On the other hand, for testing purposes, Modelsim can be used. There is a test bench implemented in a tb.v file which can be simulated and run using Modelsim.
